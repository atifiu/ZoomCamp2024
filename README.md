### üèÅ Docker & SQL 

In this homework we'll prepare the environment and practice with Docker and SQL

#### Question 1. Knowing docker tags
Run the command to get information on Docker

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - Automatically remove the container when it exits
<p>
--delete<br>
--rc<br>
--rmc<br>
:white_check_mark: --rm<br>
</p>

#### Question 2. Understanding docker first run
Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash. Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list ).

What is version of the package wheel ?

:white_check_mark: 0.42.0 <br>
1.0.0 <br>
23.0.1 <br>
58.1.0 <br>

#### Question 3. Count records
How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18.

Remember that lpep_pickup_datetime and lpep_dropoff_datetime columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

15767<br>
:white_check_mark: 15612<br>
15859<br>
89009<br>

```
SELECT Count(1)
FROM   green_taxi_data_2019
WHERE  lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN
       '2019-09-18 00:00:00' AND '2019-09-18 23:59:59'
       AND lpep_dropoff_datetime BETWEEN
           '2019-09-18 00:00:00' AND '2019-09-18 23:59:59'; 
```

#### Question 4. Longest trip for each day
Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every trip on a single day, we only care about the trip with the longest distance.

2019-09-18
2019-09-16
:white_check_mark: 2019-09-26
2019-09-21

```WITH largest_trip
     AS (SELECT a.lpep_pickup_datetime,
                trip_distance,
                Dense_rank()
                  OVER(
                    ORDER BY trip_distance DESC) ranking
         FROM   green_taxi_data_2019 a)
SELECT *
FROM   largest_trip
WHERE  ranking = 1; 
```

---

#### Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs
Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?

:white_check_mark: "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"<br>
"Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"<br>
"Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens"<br>
"Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"<br>

```
SELECT     Sum(total_amount),
           b."Borough"
FROM       green_taxi_data_2019 a
INNER JOIN zones b
ON         a."PULocationID" = b."Location ID"
AND        b."Borough" <> 'Unknown'
AND        a.lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-09-18 00:00:00' AND        '2019-09-18 23:59:59'
GROUP BY   b."Borough" havi ng sum(a.total_amount) > 50000;
```

#### Question 6. Largest tip
For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's tip , not trip

Central Park<br>
Jamaica<br>
:white_check_mark: JFK Airport<br>
Long Island City/Queens Plaza<br>

```
SELECT *
FROM   (
                  SELECT     a.tip_amount,
                             (
                                    SELECT c."Zone"
                                    FROM   zones c
                                    WHERE  c."LocationID" = a."DOLocationID") AS zone,
                             de nse_rank() OVER(ORDER BY a.tip_amount DESC)      ranking
                  FROM       green_taxi_data_2019 a
                  INNER JOIN zones b
                  ON         a."PULocationID" = b."LocationID"
                  AND        b ."Zone" = 'Astoria'
                  AND        a.lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-09-01 00:00:00' AND        '2019-09-30 23:59:59') max_tip
WHERE  ranking = 1;
```

#### Question 7. Creating Resources
After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```terraform apply```
